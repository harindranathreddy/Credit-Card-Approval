# Credit-Card-Approval

An MNC financial organisation operates in multiple geographies in various product segments (liabilities as well as credit). In the past few years, the bank has been on an expansion spree. As part of this expansion drive, it is looking to grow its customer base who purchase credit products. So, the bank is looking to push credit cards to new customers in one of the markets in which it is operating. Now, since this market is not mature in terms of data governance and reporting, the credit bureau (such as CIBIL and Experian) does not have data on all the existing card customers.

In order to expand its credit card portfolio, the bank is looking to build a credit card application approval model. Normally, banks process credit card applications based on credit bureau scores. Since this market does not have a credit bureau score for the majority of the customers, building such an application approval model becomes tricky. As the bank has some presence in the credit card space in the region, the data available to build the model contains the application data and performance of these customers.
